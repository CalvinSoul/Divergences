#All ideologies have been clumped into 3 groups for the AI. No one will ever see these, so we are hijacking them for our own purposes. The three AI groups are Democracy, Facist, and Communist
#there is a 4th ai group called neutral, but that works differently.

#Note: Because of hard coded features, democracies now use the fascist AI and the ol fascists use the neutral AI
#Note: AI changed back to all neutral ai. This is because the other AI doesn't want to be apart of things if the tension is so low (IE at game start)
