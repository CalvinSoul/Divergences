State Socialism may allow a mixed economic approach, with guided unions or limited markets, but all macroeconomic policy is decided by the ruling party. State socialism has worker’s ownership of the means of production with one step of removal; the state owns the means of production and represents the workers. \n§YEgalitarian: §!All racial categories are pseudo-scientific. Men and women are fundamentally equal and deserve equal opportunities and rights.
